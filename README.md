This repository presents a selection of my academic and creative work, including undergraduate course projects, case studies, and 3D printing projects.

## Bachelor’s Thesis (Spanish Only)

### Numerical Modeling of a Mountain Bike Frame in a Polymeric Fiber / Plastic Matrix Composite for Weight Reduction
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16945197

**Note:** This is a reconstructed version of the original work. The CAD files are not available; however, the MATLAB code has been rebuilt based on the thesis documentation.

## Undergraduate Course Projects

### - Static Analysis of the Trek Supercaliber Bicycle Frame (Not uploaded yet)
This is a reconstructed case study. The CAD model is available only as a simplified sample, along with the FEM simulations, due to data loss.

### - 5 kW Wind Turbine Drivetrain – Case Study 
This is a reconstructed case study. The CAD model is not available due to data loss; however, the analysis and design rationale are documented. [View](undergraduated-course-projects/Wind_Turbine_5KW)
